{"Artist": "King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard", "Title": "Honey", "Lyric": "You taste like honey, all warm and runny Kinder than a candy, effervescent shandy Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along And the germs outside I'll keep you from Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song While the mead I make can brew for you You taste like honey You taste like honey You taste like honey Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it We're endless motion, drink to that notion Buoyant is your spirit, gotta keep me near it Like the wind on a sail I'll steer you along And the germs outside I'll keep you from Like the hail in the morn' I'll sing you a song While the mead I make can brew for you You taste like honey You taste like honey You taste like honey You taste like honey You taste like honey You taste like honey Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion"}
