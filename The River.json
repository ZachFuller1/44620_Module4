{"Artist": "King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard", "Title": "The River", "Lyric": "Once you're in the zone The river flows down like a full stone Water is your bed The ripples cushion your head I can't believe it, it is frozen It's not the first time, I had noticed She will deliver, I am floating Trust in the river I had floated down, floated down Floated down, floated down Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Once you're where I led It will be clear what I have said Float without a home The river flows like another long road I can't believe it, it is frozen It's not the first time, I had noticed She will deliver, I am floating Trust in the river I had floated down, floated down Floated down, floated down Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Frozen over home The fading light shines on the white stone Melt your little zone And sink into the waterfall flow I can't believe it, it is frozen It's not the first time, I had noticed She will deliver, I am floating Trust in the river I had floated down, floated down Floated down, floated down Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Down, down down, down down, down down (The river) Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)"}
