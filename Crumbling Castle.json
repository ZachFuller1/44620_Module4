{"Artist": "King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard", "Title": "Crumbling Castle", "Lyric": "Meet me glassy eyed, blind, and divine Under a void on the ghost land The castle is a pimple on the face of the world The embers burned for ghouls to tread if you\u2019d please try I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle Inching closer each century, crumbling castle Are we safe in our citadel? Look upon our condition, crumbling castle You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle We pray for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle Dug all of our holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle Are we safe in our holding cell? Look upon our condition, crumbling castle We head to our extinction, crumbling castle The sounds of the constant lightning Would be enough to block out the Fall of the end of the world if that were [?] crumble down In the wind I sway, back and forth I'm brittle as an aged human being When my walls are safe from world weather The build forms into great nastiness Polygondwanaland I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle I don't want to fall into dust I don't want nothing but to live on The ache inside my keep spurs me on I don't want to be visible Polygondwanaland I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle On this very day, in one thousand Years the earth will be relative to the Sun and the moon and a new world will be Created, I know because it is written here I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle Inching closer each century, crumbling castle Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle Are we safe in our citadel? Look upon our condition, crumbling castle You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle"}
